library
=======

Light-weight Library MS using Python, Flask, Jinja2, MongoDB and TwitterBootstrap. Aimed for deployment in at my work which currently has a paper based system :/
Currently @ http://library-shelf.herokuapp.com/shelf

You can search the shelf or search for a book and add it to the shelf.
Crude checkout is now implemented! 

Next Steps:
Add a better checkout feedback.
Add a user page to show user info and checked out books.
Add a admin interface with reporting and import functions.
Add a request queue pool where all checkout requests are queued.
Add ability for the admin to process each request and grant checkout.
Add a user checkin function.
